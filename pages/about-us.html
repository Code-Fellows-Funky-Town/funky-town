                <li>Chris Ceder</li>
                    <p>I have spend pretty much my entire adult career life in the construction fields. From working on roofs to driving dump trucks.
                        I have don it all. About the beginning of spring I decided I needed a change. After talking with quite a few people I decided 
                        getting into tech was the best idea for a long and exciting career. I looked at a few school, but after doing some research I
                        decided that Code Fellows way the best choice for me. Once I become a full stack developer I do not really know where I want to 
                        work or even live. All I know is there better be water close by for me to scuba dive!! </p>
                <li>ilker Zaimoglu</li>
                    <p>I am Ilker Zaimoglu, Mechanical Engineer, Sales Director & Business Developer and now on the path of becoming a Software Developer.
                        I have combined my engineering  and business skills with my integrity and empathy  strengths. I have worked hard and passionate 
                        to stretch my goals to product and business development in 3 different sectors simultaneously. By my long term plans and strategies 
                        I have put my company brands to the US market and had the glory of 40% growth of Sales each here. I have made my brands top qualit
                        known  in different sectors. Software development is the future, and the key factor of the new jobs have not been invented, yet. 
                        It is the most efficient skill and tool for the new business models that have been invented recently and will have been invented soon. 
                        Also the data, actually the big data is the most powerful tool in every sector. It was before whoever has the gold, makes the rules, 
                        now whoever has the data, makes the rules. I am inspired the power of the big data. I am currently studying Software Development at 
                        Code Fellows. I am talented at business and marketing and have engineering skills.  I am looking for insight as to how I can best 
                        position myself for a role that combine my experiences and existence skills with my new powerful developer skill. This will be widen 
                        my horizon, I am looking forward to use it at my current company to ensure my company competitor in the industry, in the meanwhile to 
                        transition my career path to the new sector that I am passionate.
