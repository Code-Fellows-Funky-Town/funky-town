## Project Description
### Back Side Story
Global warming because of carbon dioxide consumption and Americans are getting fat and unhealthy. The Federal Government is asking an app that will be useful for the public to convince them to exercise and not to use cars. Seattle is chosen for a Beta project because of the cooperation of the city government.

## Overall Problem Domain
### Problem Domain
If we would make an app that allows people to choose a route by easily calculating calories burned and route duration by simply drawing a route on a map. People will see the benefits and the city government is ready to cover some portion of their health insurance because of their using this app.  It is called PROJECT CSS. If this Beta project is successful, the other city governments will be willing to apply to get Federal Government benefits and supports.

### Method of the Project
We will take the average scientific data  for walking, running  and biking,
* Data how many calories an average person can burn by walking, running and biking.
* Data how long it takes for an average person to walk, run or bike.
We will calculate the distance by mouse drawing on a Seattle map  
We will calculate the duration and calories lost from the mileage and scientific data.
